# Welcome to the Complete C, C++ and Object-Oriented Programming Course

Hello everyone! I'm Guilherme Ribeiro de Macedo, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Bras√≠lia (UnB) and graduated in Systems Analysis and Development from Senac. I'm excited to learn and share everything I'll learn in this comprehensive C and C++ course.

## What I'll Learn

- Develop programs in C and C++
- Use the Code::Blocks development environment to write and test my code
- Work with different variable types like Int, Float, Char, and Boolean
- Perform mathematical and logical operations to create program logic
- Create simple (IF) and compound (Switch Case) conditional structures
- Use logical connectors (AND, OR, NOT) to create complex conditions
- Build loops (While, For) to automate repetitive tasks
- Develop interactive menus to enhance user experience in my programs
- Define constants for easier code maintenance and readability
- Manipulate and access arrays and matrices to store and process structured data
- Learn about pointers for advanced memory manipulation
- Dynamically allocate memory to efficiently manage system resources
- Build and use structs (structures) to organize related data
- Read from and write to external files for permanent data storage
- Implement search and sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, among others
- Develop simple games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Battleship, and Hangman to apply learned concepts
- Implement operations with queues and stacks for efficient data management
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming: Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
- Use UML diagrams to model and plan program structures
- Participate in an extra course on Agile Project Management with Scrum to learn effective software project management

## Repository Structure

- `/lessons`: Contains codes and exercises from theoretical classes for review and practice
- `/exercises`: Practical exercises that help solidify learning
- `/games`: Game projects developed throughout the course to apply our skills
- `/data_structures`: Implementations of data structures and sorting algorithms for further study
- `/object_oriented`: Examples and exercises related to object-oriented programming in C++

I'm excited to start this journey of learning to program! Let's program!
